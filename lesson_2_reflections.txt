What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

The .git subdirectory is created. This is necessary to enable tracking of
changes to the directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area contains files that will be committed to the repository. This
allows you to selectively commit files from your working directory. It can make
it easier to commit one logical change at a time if you made multiple logical
changes since your last commit.
